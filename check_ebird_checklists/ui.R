              HTML("<p>For larger areas or longer time periods, a very large number of checklists might be flagged. Doing one month at a time for an individual county might be a reasonable approach. Also, in some cases, a single check might account for a large share of the flagged checklists. In our experience, this can happen with no_observer_mismatch. In this case, to reduce the burden, you can deselect the offending check. <p>"),
              HTML("<p><li>ampm: A frequent issue is for the time to be entered as AM instead of PM (i.e., in the middle of the night, rather than in the afternoon).</li>
                  <li>midnight: Starting a checklist at midnight should be quite uncommon, but it's often used to enter day-list or incorrectly add time on a historical/incidental list without time.</li>
                  <li>high_number_species: Checklists with an exceptionally high number of species (<b>X</b>, relative to your region) are generally indicative of multi-day lists or list-building.</li>
                  <li>only_one_species: A complete checklist with a single species is often indicative of incorrectly checking the 'Complete' button. Nocturnal checklists are not flagged, as it is quite common to only have one species when owling.</li>
                  <li>same_count_all_species: Most commonly occurs when the number of individuals for every species is 1, in which case it is possible that the correct selection should be X to mark presence.</li>
                  <li>multi_day: Checklists that span over two days are not valid.</li>
                  <li>too_many_observers: Checklists with more than <b>X</b> people could represent multi-party effort or some other issue.</li>
                  <li>too_short_duration: Checklists with a high number of species relative to the duration are suspicious.</li>
                  <li>too_fast: Catch protocol issues with incoherent duration and distance</li>
                  <li>complete_media: Checklists marked as complete with a media for each species often tend to rather be 'Incomplete' checklists.</li>
                  <li>not_stationary: Staionary checklists with more than <b>X</b> species could be traveling checklists.</li>
                  <li>not_traveling: Traveling checklists of less than 30 m should be entered as stationary.</li>
                  <li>pelagic_too_long: Checklists with the pelagic protocol are flagged if they are longer than 75 minutes.</li>
                  <li>specialized_protocol: You might want to check the use of non-standard protocols.</li>
                  <li>no_observer_mismatch: Flagged when a checklist is shared with a larger number of people than the indicated number of observers.</li>
                  <li>too_long_distance_land: A checklist of more than <b>X</b> km could be invalid based on distance covered. This check is only run on checklists from land or less than 2 miles offshore.</li>
                  <li>too_long_distance_offshore: Offshore checklists (more than 2 miles from land) over <b>X</b> km might be invalid based on distance covered. The acceptable distance for an offshore list can be longer than that for an onshore list.</li><br><br>
